Fake news has been there since the dawn of ages. Fake news existed even before the Internet was a thing. However, with the boom of technology, we use the Internet more than anything else. Hence, making sure that the breaking news we are seeing is genuine and not just a hoax to unnecessarily grab attention. Anything fictitious, like articles that are deliberately fabricated to deceive the readers. 

Social media and news outlets publish fake news to increase readership and catch as many people as possible to increase their profit. Since this is only good for monetary purposes and can cause more harm than good, I have tried to make a Fake News detection model. It can learn from the data we have online and then make decisions based on the historical references and structures to identify if the news is real or fake. Such click-baits lure users and entice curiosity with flashy headlines or designs to click links to increase advertisements revenues.
